# SeatSnap v0.1
SeatSnap is an app for reminding and scheduling flight check-ins. This is my final project for [Code Louisville's](https://github.com/CodeLouisville) January 2016 Front-End Development program. 

## Overview
SeatSnap is a convenience app with two core features:

**Check-In Reminder**: alerts users via SMS whenever they're able to check-in to their flight, usually 24-hours before departure.

**Check-In Scheduler**: processes a user's check-in without any additional actions, which is taken care of by a SeatSnap rep for $5.

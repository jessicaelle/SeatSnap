<h2>About</h2>
<p>SeatSnap is a web application designed to help you <strong>remember</strong>
  and <strong>schedule</strong> flight check-ins for a variety of US airlines.</p>
<h3>Remind</h3>
<span class="subtitle">First to know, first in line.</span>
<p>SeatSnap's Remind feature is simple. Plug in your flight data and we'll send
  an SMS text message to your phone a few minutes before your airline allows you
  to check-in to your flight.</p>
<p>The SMS message will contain the URL to your airline's check-in page, allowing
  you to quickly and easily reserve your spot in the queue. Say goodbye to C seats!</p>
<h3>Schedule</h3>
<span class="subtitle">Flight check-ins, hassle-free.</span>
<p>Want someone else to check-in for you? We can do that! SeatSnap's Schedule feature
  takes the hassle out of check-ins by having someone ready and on-call to check-in
  on your behalf. Think of it as a concierge service for frequent flyers.</p>
<p>Simply plug in your flight data, pay $5 to get your own flight check-in assistant,
  and you're set. We'll email you with info on when we checked in, your queue number,
  and more depending on your airline. It's easy!</p>

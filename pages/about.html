<h2>About SeatSnap</h2>
<p>SeatSnap is a simple web application designed to help you remember
  and schedule flight check-ins for domestic airlines.</p>
<h3>Remind</h3>
<p>SeatSnap's Remind feature is simple. Plug in your flight data and we'll send
  an SMS and email one hour before your airline allows you
  to check-in to your flight.</p>
<p>Both messages will contain a link to your airline's check-in page, allowing
  quick and easy reservations. Say goodbye to C seats!</p>

<h3>Schedule</h3>
<p>SeatSnap's Schedule feature takes the hassle out of check-ins by having someone
  check-in for you, right on time. Think of it as a concierge service for frequent flyers.</p>
<p>Simply plug in your flight data, pay $5 to get your own flight check-in assistant,
  and you're set. We'll email you with info on when we checked in, your queue number,
  and more depending on the airline. It's easy!</p>
